# Car-Rental-Service-Database

# Introduction
As more and more people tend to move towards renting instead of ownership due to high maintenance and fuel costs, we have created a fully functional database application which could be used to manage a car rental company and its services. Users may sign up for the application. Authorized personnel with a predetermined combination of username and password can create and delete bookings, modify vehicle data, and access multiple other features of the projects.
